# Logistic Regression Project. 

## In this project we will be working with the UCI adult dataset. We will be attempting to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year.

Initially data is cleaned and made some changes for the convenience of model. 

The data is then plotted for Exploratory Data Analysis. 

Then the data is divided as Train/Test in a ration of 70/30. 

Logistic regression is performed with "Income" as target variable and all othe variables as predictors. 

The model is then predicted with the test data. Class matrix is taken with the priciple class p(x>0.5) = >50K, else <=50K

Finally test error and accuracy of the model is determined. 

The test error of the model is 0.148329

The accuracy of the model is 85.1671 %
